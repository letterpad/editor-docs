## Plugins

The letterpad editor comes with some basic plugins which will allow you to compose mixed content.

## Concept

In Letterpad Editor, most plugins takes care of 4 essential responsibilites.

1. Rendering a tag
2. Rendering through markdown
3. Serliazing HTML content
4. Deserializing HTML content

We will get into more details while writing a plugin.

A plugin may render itself as a node or as a mark or may not render anything.

**Node**

By default, a node element occupies the entire space of its parent element \(container\), thereby creating a `block`.

> A node element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available \(stretches out to the left and right as far as it can\).

Examples: `div`, `header`, `footer`, `section`, etc. are all node type.

A node element can contain marks in it. eg.

```markup
<section>
    <strong>Bold</strong> is a mark inside the node <code>section</code>. It can
    also contain <em>italics</em>
</section>
```

**Mark**

A mark is used to format or describe a string of characters in your editor. Examples include basic formatting, like bold, italics, and underline, but they can also be used to implement more complex features. The basic idea is that if it can be implemented by describing a range of the characters, but doesnâ€™t affect the structure of the document, marks are a good choice.
