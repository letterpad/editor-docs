# Introduction

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/letterpad/editor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/letterpad/editor)

The leterpad editor is an extract from the
[Letterpad CMS](http://github.com/letterpad/letterpad-cms).

This editor gives a high level api of the [slate editor](https://slatejs.org) along with a flexible plugin architecture. It comes with a bunch of rich plugins for most of your use cases. You can extend any of the plugins or create your own plugins. The letterpad editor has a dynamic markdown editor which renders the preview inline as you type.

#### Why this editor ?

The idea comes from the Medium editor. I found the medium editor as one of the most minimalistic editor limited by its features and not open source. While developing the Letterpad project which is react CMS for blogs, I wanted to give a similar experience and also make it opensource. The editor worked out so well, that I decided to extract it from Letterpad into its own repository so that others can use it in their own projects.
