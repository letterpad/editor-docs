# Plugins

The letterpad editor comes with some basic plugins which will allow to create mixed content. Currently we have the below plugins:

-   Rich Text (bold, italic, underline, link, headings)
-   List (ordered and unordered)
-   Image
-   Gallery
-   Codeblock
-   Highlight words
-   Audio
-   Blockquote
-   Embed

You can build your own plugins based on your requirements. You can read more about how to write a plugin in the the section [Writing a Plugin](WRITEPLUGIN.md)
